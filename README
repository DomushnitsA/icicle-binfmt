A rudimentary platform-independent program loader and
compatibility layer.

You can try it out by building and then using loader on the demo program:

    sh build.sh
    ./load demo.prog

It's not implicitly clear what this project attempts to do, so I'll explain
a bit. Whenever need arises, we'll design bunch of interfaces that work
across systems. Others will write their programs into containers that we
have designed. Later anyone can download anyone other's program and get it work
on their platform directly with no dependency- or software-originated compatibility issues.

Well.. that's the plan. Please submit some issues or patches.
